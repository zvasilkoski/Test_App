Topic: Future Value vs. Present Value
Question: Which of the following statements accurately describes the relationship between future value and present value?
A) Future value is always less than present value due to inflation.
B) Present value refers to the process of moving money backward in time, while future value refers to moving money forward in time.
C) Present value involves addition of interest, while future value involves subtraction of interest.
D) Future value and present value calculations use different interest rates for the same time period.
E) The future value of an amount will equal its present value when the interest rate is zero.
Answer: B
Explanation: Present value is the current worth of a future sum of money, calculated by "discounting" (moving backward in time), while future value is the value of a present sum of money at a specified date in the future, calculated by "compounding" (moving forward in time). Option B correctly describes this relationship. Option E is also true but not as comprehensive - when interest rate is zero, future value equals present value because no interest accrues. Options A, C, and D contain incorrect statements about the relationship between future and present value.

Topic: On Nominal Rates vs. Periodic Rates
Question: A bank advertises a nominal annual interest rate of 8% compounded quarterly. What is the periodic rate used for calculations in each quarter?
A) 8%
B) 2%
C) 0.5%
D) 8.24%
E) 32%
Answer: B
Explanation: The periodic rate (IPER) is calculated by dividing the nominal rate (INOM) by the number of compounding periods per year (M). In this case, the nominal rate is 8% and since it's compounded quarterly, there are 4 periods per year. Therefore, IPER = INOM/M = 8%/4 = 2%. This is the rate that would be applied to the balance each quarter. Options A (8%) is the nominal annual rate, not the periodic rate. Option D (8.24%) is closer to the effective annual rate (EAR) if calculated, and options C and E are incorrect calculations.

Topic: On Financial calculator solutions (using HP10BII)
Question: You need to calculate the future value of $5,000 invested for 6 years at 7.5% annual interest compounded monthly. Which of the following represents the correct sequence of keystrokes and inputs on an HP10BII calculator?
A) Enter 6 → N, Enter 7.5 → I/YR, Enter 5000 → PV, Enter 0 → PMT, Press FV
B) Enter 72 → N, Enter 7.5 → I/YR, Enter -5000 → PV, Enter 0 → PMT, Press FV
C) Enter 72 → N, Enter 0.625 → I/YR, Enter -5000 → PV, Enter 0 → PMT, Press FV
D) Enter 6 → N, Enter 7.5 → I/YR, Enter -5000 → PV, Enter 0 → PMT, Enter 12 → P/YR, Press FV
E) Enter 72 → N, Enter 7.5/12 → I/YR, Enter -5000 → PV, Enter 0 → PMT, Press FV
Answer: C
Explanation: For monthly compounding over 6 years, you need 72 periods (6×12). The periodic interest rate is the nominal annual rate divided by the number of periods per year (7.5%/12 = 0.625%). The PV is entered as negative (-5000) because it represents an outflow (investment). PMT is 0 since this is a lump sum investment. Option C correctly shows these entries. Options A and D use incorrect period counts. Option B uses the wrong periodic interest rate. Option E shows the calculation (7.5/12) rather than its result.

Topic: On Ordinary Annuities vs. Annuity Due
Question: An investor has two options for a $10,000 investment that pays $1,000 annually for 15 years:
Option 1: An ordinary annuity with payments at the end of each year
Option 2: An annuity due with payments at the beginning of each year
If both investments earn 6% annual interest, which of the following statements is correct?
A) The present value of Option 1 (ordinary annuity) will be higher because the payments start later.
B) The present value of Option 2 (annuity due) will be higher because the payments start sooner.
C) The future value of Option 1 (ordinary annuity) will be higher because interest compounds longer.
D) Both options have identical present values because the total amount paid is the same.
E) The future value of Option 2 (annuity due) will be exactly 6% higher than the ordinary annuity.
Answer: B
Explanation: In an annuity due, payments occur at the beginning of each period, which means they're received sooner than in an ordinary annuity (where payments occur at the end of each period). Since money received earlier has more time to earn interest and is worth more in present value terms (time value of money principle), Option 2 (annuity due) will have a higher present value. In fact, the present value of an annuity due equals the present value of an ordinary annuity multiplied by (1+i), where i is the interest rate per period. Option A is incorrect - earlier payments result in higher PV, not lower. Options C, D, and E contain incorrect statements about the relationship between ordinary annuities and annuity due.

Topic: On Amortization Schedules
Question: A $200,000 mortgage loan is amortized over 30 years at an annual interest rate of 5%. Which of the following statements regarding the loan's amortization schedule is correct?
A) The monthly payment remains constant throughout the loan term, but the proportion of interest to principal in each payment changes over time.
B) The principal portion of each payment decreases over time, while the interest portion increases.
C) The total interest paid over the life of the loan will be less than the original loan amount.
D) In the first year of payments, more than 50% of each monthly payment is applied to principal reduction.
E) The final payment of the loan will have the same interest-to-principal ratio as the first payment.
Answer: A
Explanation: In a standard amortization schedule for a fixed-rate mortgage, the monthly payment remains constant throughout the loan term. However, the composition of each payment changes over time - initially, payments consist mostly of interest with little principal reduction, but as the loan balance decreases, more of each payment goes toward principal and less toward interest. Option B is incorrect because the principal portion actually increases over time while the interest portion decreases. Option C is incorrect for a typical 30-year mortgage at 5%, where total interest would exceed the original loan amount. Option D is incorrect because in the early years of a mortgage, the majority of each payment (often more than 80%) goes toward interest, not principal. Option E is incorrect because the final payment will have much more principal and much less interest than the first payment.
